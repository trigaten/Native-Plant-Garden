 <center><h1>How this website works</h1></center>
 <p>
Basically, all the information on this site is stored on a Google Sheet owned by a teacher at Friends School. 
Using the Google Sheet API, this website connects to and reads the google sheet. It then stores the information 
temporarily in the browser until it is needed for a search or a display.
