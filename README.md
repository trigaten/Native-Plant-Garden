# Native-Plant-Gardens
A Google sheet API driven site that displays native plant information from around the Friends School campus.

## Features that should be added:
  * Better displays - just all around website needs to be beautified
  * Search Engine 
    * Needs to return more accurate results
    * When displaying results maybe should do color gradient (for example, the more relevant (higher scored) a plant is, the brighter a shade of green it should be displayed in)
  * A number of small display problems
  * check Github "projects" list for this repository
  * Whatever y'all think
